"""Playwright-driven sign-in: the only login UX an end user should see.

Tool opens a real Chromium window pointed at the vendor's login URL. The user does
exactly what they would do anywhere else — type credentials, complete 2FA, solve any
CAPTCHA. While that happens we poll the browser context's cookie jar; when the
vendor's session-defining cookie appears we wait a short settle window, grab every
cookie, and close the browser.

No DevTools, no curl, no library decryption — the same TLS session the user
authenticated through is the one whose cookies we keep.
